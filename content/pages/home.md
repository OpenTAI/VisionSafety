          A new indivisual attack method PMA (Probability Margin Attack) is
          introduced to achieve the strongest indivisual attack performance
          using a probability margin loss. An improved ensemble PMA+ is then
          developped, which is stronger than AutoAttack.

          We provide a million-level dataset, cc1m, constructed based on cc3m.
          The large number of samples allows for more accurate evaluation of
          model robustness (generalization). One dataset can be used to evaluate
          all downstream tasks.

          We propose a novel diffusion-based framework called DiffPatch for

          Our DiffPatch achieves the highest attack success rate (ASR),
          significantly reducing the mAP of various object detectors, rivaling
          or even surpassing the current state-of-the-art methods of unnatural
          adversarial patches.

          further research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
          dataset for physical adversarial attacks.
