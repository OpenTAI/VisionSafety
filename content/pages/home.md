          Enhanced Single Attack Method PMA and More Efficient Combined Attack
          Method PMA+
        titlezh: '白盒攻击评测亮点 #111'
        texten: >-
          We introduce a new attack method called PMA (Probability Margin
          Attack), which utilizes the newly proposed Probability Margin Loss
          function. Additionally, we present a more efficient combined attack
          method, PMA+.

          For single attack evaluations, our toolbox supports combinations of
          different strategies and loss functions. In multi-attack evaluations,
          it allows for the combination of various attack methods.

          We provide data processing and evaluation tools for CIFAR10, CIFAR100,
          and ImageNet. Furthermore, we introduce a million-sample dataset,
          cc1m, constructed from cc3m, enabling more accurate model robustness
          assessments through large-scale evaluation.

          We utilize multiple graphics cards and multiple models to enhance the
          transferability of adversarial examples. By employing 8 mainstream
          pre-trained image feature extractors for feature extraction and
          perturbation at the feature layer, we generate highly transferable
          adversarial examples.

          We provide a million-level dataset, cc1m, constructed based on cc3m.
          The large number of samples allows for more accurate evaluation of
          model robustness (generalization). One dataset can be used to evaluate
          all downstream tasks.
